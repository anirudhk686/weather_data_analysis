# weather_data_analysis
In this project i have analyzed antartic weather data. This project was part of my research internship at [National Centre for Antarctic and Ocean Research](http://www.ncaor.gov.in/) , India. Here temperature data has been analyzed with
the Seasonal ARIMA model. Then I have predicted the future values with the help of the obtained model. Wind speed analysis was also done. Here main objective was to find out the monthly blizzard distribution.

#### Detailed methodology followed in this analysis is described in this [report](https://github.com/anirudhk686/weather_data_analysis/blob/master/Final_report.pdf).
